                    The knockout viewmodel plugin runs <a href="http://jsperf.com/ko-viewmodel-vs-ko-mapping-complex-viewmodel-creation">several times faster</a> than the knockout mapping plugin. It also allows you to fine tune your viewmodel creation for even more speed. 
                    Now you can create complex observable viewmodels easily and with more structure and control than ever before!

                <h3>What is a viewmodel?</h3>
                <p>In knockout a viewmodel is the model(json data) modified with any observables, computeds, and functions needed by the view (html with bindings). A lot of knockout tutorials start by showing a manually built model with values wrapped in observables. In real world use a json model coming down a your server needs to be mapped to a viewmodel. And in order to update the server with changes this mapping will need to be reversed. The viewmodel plugin lets you do this mapping in a maintainable, flexable way.</p>

                <h3>Creating a simple viewmodel</h3>
                <p>This code creates an viewModel with an observable array of users whose properties are observable.</p>
                <pre><code>
model = {//your model is normally provided via an ajax call
  users:[ 
        {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"},
        {firstName:"James", lastName:"Smith"}
    ]
};

viewmodel = ko.viewmodel.fromModel(model);
			</code></pre>
			<p>This example relies on the default mapping provided by fromModel. These rules can be overridden by passing in mapping options as a second parameter (discussed later).</p>
			<h5>Default Mapping</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Objects in the model are mapped to objects in the viewmodel and are not observable.</li>
			<li>All non-object json properties in the model are mapped to observables containing those values.</li>
			<li>Arrays are mapped to observablesArrays unless they are direct children of arrays, e.g. this json [ [], [] ] maps to an observable array containing two non-observable arrays. </li>

                <p>At somepoint you'll need to get an updated model to send back up to the server. This can be done by calling toModel and passing in your viewmodel.</p>

                <pre><code>
model = ko.viewmodel.toModel(viewmodel);

			<p>The toModel method follows default unmapping rules unless mapping options were specified in the original fromModel call </p>	
			<h5>Default Unmapping</h5>
					<ul>
					<li>Objects in the viewmodel are mapped to objects in a new model</li>
					<li>All observable properties, including observable arrays, are unwrapped and added to the model</li>

                <h3>Updating a viewmodel</h3>

                <p>If you need to update your viewmodel with more recent model data this can be done by calling updateFromModel.</p>

                <pre><code>
ko.viewmodel.updateFromModel(viewmodel, updatedModel);
                </code></pre>

                <p>This method optionally takes a third parameter, makeNoncontiguousObjectUpdates. When set to true it can help eliminate long running script errors in older browsers by creating an update function for each object and calling it via setTimeout. Given the overhead of creating all of these functions makeNoncontiguousObjectUpdates should only be set to true if you are getting long running script errors in older browsers. An onComplete method allows you to pass in a callback to be fired when noncontiguous object updates are completed.</p>
                <pre><code>
ko.viewmodel.updateFromModel(viewmodel, updatedModel, true).onComplete(function(){
    //respond to completion of update
});

                <h3>Mapping Builder - Building more complicated viewmodels</h3>
                <p>
                    The basic mapping we've seen so far does a one to one mapping from properties on a model to observable properties on a viewmodel and back. This is useful but limiting. 
                    To take more control of mapping you need to use the mapping builder, which provides a chaining syntax to allow you
                    to define complex mappings from viewmodels to models and back. 
                </p>

            <section id="simpleExample" class="inner">
                <h3>A simple mapping example - Extending your viewmodel</h3>
                <p>
                    Lets say that you want to extend each object in the users array with an isDeleted flag. You define this mapping using the mapping builders extend function:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
var mapping = ko.viewmodel.mappingBuilder();
mapping.extend("{root}.users[i]",
    function extendUser(user){
        user.isDeleted = ko.observable(false);
    }
);

viewmodel = ko.viewmodel.fromModel(model, mapping));

//note: it was important to provide a name for the function above (i.e. extendUser) 
//because that name will showup in callstacks and profiling
</code></pre>
                <p>Let's take this example further by adding a delete method as well using the chaining syntax:</p>
                <pre><code>
var mapping = ko.viewmodel.mappingBuilder()
    .extend("{root}.users[i]", 
        function extendUser(user){
            user.isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
        }
    )
    .extend("{root}.users", 
        function extendUsers(users){
            users.Delete = function(user){
                user.isDeleted(true);
            };
        }
    );

viewmodel = ko.viewmodel.fromModel(model, mapping));
</code></pre>

            <section id="paths" class="inner">
                <h3>Mapping Paths</h3>

                <p>Mappings are specified for an item by it's path. Every full path starts with {root}. Items in an array are referred to as [i]. So a path of "{root}.users[i].firstName" would be used to specify custom processing for the firstName property of every object in the users array. That is its full path name, but it's not necessary to refer to every item by it's -full path name. There are three ways of referencing a path:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Full Path Name - Matches only the specific path, e.g. "{root}.users[i].firstName".</li>
                    <li>Parent Child-Name - Matches the parent child combination specified. So "users[i].firstName" will only match the first name property on objects in the users array. Array items have to be referenced as ParentName[i].ChildName but for all other objects the proper reference is ParentName.ChildName</li>
                    <li>Property Name - Matches every property with that name. So a partial path of "firstName" would match every firstName property in your model.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="processingTypes" class="inner">
                <h3>Mapping Types</h3>

                <p>
                    The viewmodel plugins default mapping maps a property to a observable and back. The Mapping Builder allows you to extend or replace this default mapping for any path. The following mapping methods are available:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>extend - The path is mapped using default mapping and then returned to be extended. All children on the path will be processed before the object is returned for extension. </li>
                    <li>custom - The default mapping for the path is replaced with the mapping you define. Mappings defined for the paths children will be ignored.</li>
                    <li>append - The path and it's children are appended as is. No observables are created. Mappings defined for the paths children will be ignored.</li>
                    <li>exclude - The path is excluded from processing. The path and it's children will not appear in the viewmodel.</li>
                    <li>arrayChildId - Defines what property of an array's child objects should to be used as an id to identify them for update purposes.</li>
                    <li>shared - Defines named processing functionaliry that can be used with extend and map.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The only processing types that can be used together for a specified path are extend and arrayChildId. If processing options are defined using a mix of full and partial paths then the most specific path wins. If multiple processing options are specified 
                    for the a full path then the first one defined will win.
                </p>

                    <h4>.extend ( path, fnMap, fnUnmap )</h4>
                    With the extend mapping the path is mapped first using default mapping and then returned to the function you specify to be extended.
                <pre><code>
var mapping = ko.viewmodel.mappingBuilder()
        .extend("{root}.users[i]", 
            function extendUser(user){
                user.isDeleted = ko.observable(false);
                return user;
            },
            function unextendUser(unmappedUser){
                //the user has been unmapped including all observables properties 
                //isDeleted was an observable and must be manually removed
                delete unmappedUser.isDeleted;
                return unmappedUser;
            }
        );

        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The value of the path is passed to the extend function after processing has been completed on the path and its children. Objects can be modified without being returned. 
            Note: Whatever is returned from the extend function will be persisted and replace the default processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: The unmap function is an optional parameter. An alternate way to unmap an extend call is using the unmapExtend method below. Unmapping need not be specified unless cleanup of the unmapped object is needed.

<h4>.unmapExtend ( path, fnMap, fnUnmap )</h4>

                    </code></pre>
                    Functions added with extend will be removed when your model is created, however observables will not be and can be removed using unmap if they will cause 
                    problems with servers side serialization. It should be noted that in many cases serialization will drop unexpected properties instead of throwing an 
                    error, so this is not always necessary and would depend on your platform.

                <section id="customOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>custom - processing option</h4>
                    The custom processing gives you complete control over mapping and unmapping from model to viewmodel and back, though as in the example below you can
                    make additional calls to viewmodel to make things simpler. One case this is often used for is in translating back and forth from a server format (think date values) or structure
                    to a format or structure that is easier to work with in javascript.
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    custom:{
        "{root}.users[i]": function(user){
            user.isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
            return user;
        }
    }
};
         </code></pre>

                    There is also this alternate syntax if you need to do unmapping
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    custom:{
        "{root}.users[i]": {
            map:function(user){
                var mapped = ko.viewmodel.fromModel(user);
                mapped().isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
                return mapped;
            },
            unmap:function(user){
                var unmapped = ko.viewmodel.toModel(user);
                delete unmapped.isDeleted;
                return unmapped;
            }
        }
    }
};
        </code></pre>
                    In this case the users are passed through as is with the addition of an observable isDeleted flag.
                <br />
                    Note: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure to return something from your function, otherwise undefined will be returned as the result of custom.</li>
                    <li>The object passed into map is the unaltered object from your viewmodel or model (depending on if you are calling fromModel or toModel).</li>

    append:["{root}.users[i]"]

        </code></pre>

};
                </code></pre>
                    The firstName property is not included.

                    <li>the path specified will not be wrapped in an observable.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>if the path is for a computed value it will be unwrapped.</li>
                    <li>if the path is for a non-observable value it will be included.</li>

                <section id="idOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>arrayChildId - processing option</h4>
                    The arrayChildId option allows you to flag what the id is on an object within an array of objects so that those objects can be updated and not replaced when updateFromModel is called. 
                    If an arrayChildId is not specified then when updated data is loaded all old items will be removed from the array and new items added, which will 
                    cause you to loose the state of those objects. The syntax for this is simple:
                <pre><code>
options:{ 
    arrayChildId:{
        "{root}.users":"id"
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                    But this will make more sense in context. What if you had an array of items for purchase and the selected items were added to your total. 
                The code might look similar to this:

                <pre><code>
var model = {
    items:[
        {
            id:256889,
            name:"item Name",
            description:"Description of Item",
            availble:3,
            price:4.25
        }
    ]
};

var viewmodel = ko.viewmodel(model, { 
    arrayChildId:{//child item id
        "{root}.items":"id"
    },
    extend:{
        "{root}.items":function(items){//Toggle function added to array for better performance
            items.ToggleSelect = function (item){
                item.selected(!item.selected);
            }
            return items;
        },
        "{root}.items[i]":function (item){
            item.selected = ko.observable(false);
        }
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                    So now imagine the app is regularly pinging the server to for an updated model so that the number of items available is accurate. 
            Without the arrayChildId option every time an update came back the array would be populated again and all of the items would be 
            extended with selected set to false. With the arrayChildId specified selected state of all objects will be maintained.

                    <h4>shared - processing option</h4>
                    This option allows you to define processing functions that can be reference by name in the extend and custom processing options, 
                    thus eliminating duplicate code. The following example shows a model for a movies with showtimes. The options extend both 
                    the movies and the showtimes with an observable property called selected.

                    Another common use of this functionality would be if you had date, currency, or other formatting that needed to be applied to a large number of item. Or
                perhaps for a large number of fields you wanted "N/A" to be displayed if their were no values. This functionality could be defined once in shared
                and reference in many places by name.

                <h3>Global Options</h3>
                <p>
                    Global options affect all calls to ko.viewmodel and are access and set via ko.viewmodel.options. Currently there are two global options:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>logging - (default:false) logs viewmodel processing to the console, including all paths processed and mapping options applied.</li>
                    <li>makeChildArraysObservable - (default:true) determines if nested arrays are converted to observable arrays. 
                        Set to false for compatibility with original mapping plugin or to improve performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="arrayMethods" class="inner">
                <h3>Observable Array Mapping Methods</h3>
                Once an observable array has been mapped, items which need to be added and removed can be processed through viewmodel mapping using the following
                methods which are added to the observable array.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>pushFromModel - modifies the object passed in according to the original mapping options, and calls array.push</li>
                    <li>unshiftFromModel - modifies the object passed in according to the original mapping options and calls array.unshift</li>
                    <li>popToModel - calls array.pop and unmaps and returns the object according to the original mapping options</li>
                    <li>shiftToModel - calls array.shift and unmaps and returns the object according to the original mapping options</li>
                </ul>
