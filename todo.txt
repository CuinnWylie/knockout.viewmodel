Possible Problems
Creating observable arrays within arrays of objects is inefficient
	Can always map or append
		so is this a prob?
			no.

Nested arrays are currently not observable but are getting extended, is this a prob?

Need a way to map and continue processing
		Why
			as a way to not have an observable array but still have observable children
				are there any alternatives
					not without more mapping options
			what is the main purpose of map
							to translate values
			as a way to manually map an object in part?
				in what way that the current options don't allow?
					not sure
					convert from undesireable enum format to better one
						does tnis need additional mapping?
							No
					what else?
						make an object and its children observable
							why would you want to make an object observable?
								swap it out?
									how would you map it's children later
										they could manually do the same technique
